# Conditionals

Conditionals in Misti surround the condition with keywords.

```Misti
if condition do
    // Expressions
elif anotherCondition do
    // Other expressions
else
    // More expressions
```

Conditionals are expressions, they evaluate to the last expression
in each branch.

```misti
val result = if condition do value1 else value2
```
