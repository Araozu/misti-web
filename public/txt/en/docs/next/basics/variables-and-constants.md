# Variables and Constants

Misti uses `val` and `var`. Val creates a constant reference.

Variables and constants must always be initialized.

```misti
var accumulator = 0
accumulator += 1

val path = "/public/txt/en/docs/next/basics/variables-and-constants.md"
```

## Identifiers

Misti's identifiers are the same as JavaScript, __plus__ using a single quote from the second character,
the same as numbers.

```misti
variable
Variable
$variable
_variable

var1
v4r

var'
v'ar
v''ar
```
